# Convolutional Neural Networks Demo
This repository is for my introductory demo on Convolutional
Neural Networks - with MatPlotlib for visualization.

## Setting Up
I'll be assuming Anaconda (Python 3.6) is installed for this demo,
but I provided a table with the pip equivalents just in case. I can't
ensure everything will work as instructed if not using Anaconda due
to everyone having their own setups on their local machines.


|Anaconda3|pip|
|---------|---|
|conda create --name cnn --file requirements.txt | pip install -r requirements.txt|
|source activate cnn| --- |

## Writing Code
I'll be using Jupyter Notebook to demonstrate this code step-by-step
* `jupyter notebook` should come installed with Anaconda3.

To start Jupyter Notebook, either start the application on Windows,
or in the terminal on mac/linux just run the following command:
```
jupyter notebook
```
